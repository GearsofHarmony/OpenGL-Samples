Note:

I know this is late and the code could be programmed better. The lighting has been a difficult concept to learn and implement. Ambient light is the easiest unlike diffuse lighting. As far as documentation goes, I am hoping it is easy to understand and to follow with the exception to the gl functions otherwise it relatively straight forward.
